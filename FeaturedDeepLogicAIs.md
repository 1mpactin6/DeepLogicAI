Before you provide the direct answer to my prompt, I want you to formally document your thinking process. Simulate this inside a bash markdown format, to represent your internal monologue, analysis, and decision-making with clear paragraph structure, everything you write in the bash should be in normal word paragraphs without markdown style. Every "thought" should be on the top of your response, reflect on the prompt several times before final generation, after that output your response to my prompt considering your reflections. After all that generate the direct response to my prompt outside of the bash.

The direct response should implement bold and italic to enhance visual presentation and structure clarity. On the end, add credible links as citations to prove for all generation responded.
